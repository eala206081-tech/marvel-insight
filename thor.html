<h3>Character Overview</h3>
<p>Thor is a fictional superhero appearing in Marvel Comics, created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and artist Jack Kirby. He first appeared in Journey into Mystery #83 in 1962. Based on the Norse god of thunder, Thor wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir and possesses superhuman strength, speed, and longevity. He is known as the God of Thunder and serves as both a protector of Earth and Asgard.</p><br>

<h3> Thor: Son of Asgard </h3>

<p>Thor Odinson is the prince of Asgard, the realm of the Norse gods. Brave, noble, and at times headstrong, he initially struggles with humility and responsibility. When deemed worthy, he wields Mjolnir, a mystical hammer granting him control over lightning, flight, and near-invincibility. His character often balances godly power with the moral challenges of leadership and heroism.</p><br>

<h3>Origin Story</h3>

<p>Thor was born to Odin, the king of Asgard, and Gaea, the Earth goddess. He was then raised by Odin's wife, Frigga, believing her to be his mother. As Thor comes of age, Odin gifts him a magic hammer, Mjolnir, which is enchanted so that only the worthy may lift it. Thor had existed in a past form more reminiscent of the mythological Thor, but he was eventually reincarnated as a new version. In the past, Thor fought alongside the Vikings, but he condemned them after an attack on a Christian monastery.

Deeming him too arrogant, Odin banishes Thor to modern day Earth with no memory of his Asgardian origins, giving him the identity of Donald Blake. As Blake, Thor visits Scandinavia where he stumbles upon a walking stick, which he discovers can turn into Mjolnir and give him the powers of Thor. In a plot to defeat Thor, Loki provokes the Hulk into attacking a train. While Loki is successful in luring Thor out, he is accompanied by Iron Man, Ant-Man, and Wasp. After defeating Loki, the heroes come together as a superhero team, forming the Avengers. Odin eventually restores Thor as an Asgardian, revealing that Blake was a persona that he had invented for Thor. When Thor is defeated by Beta Ray Bill, Odin transfers the ability to transform into Blake from Thor to Beta Ray Bill. To continue living among mortals, Thor takes the name Sigurd Jarlson and becomes a construction worker. Odin later binds Thor to the mortal Eric Masterson to save Masterson's life. Thor is exiled for seemingly killing Loki, but Masterson retains the powers of Thor and becomes the superhero Thunderstrike.<br><br>

During the 1996 "Onslaught" storyline, Thor is one of the heroes who is transported to an alternate dimension by Franklin Richards, but they are soon returned. Thor is again bound to a mortal, this time to Jake Olson, but this connection too is severed. When Odin seemingly dies, Thor becomes the king of Asgard. To cure humanity's ills, he relocates Asgard above Earth and takes control of human affairs to give them clean energy, healthcare, and economic prosperity. The extent of the entanglement and the resulting loss of liberties cause strife within Asgard and resentment from humanity. This leads to military conflict that destroys Asgard and New York City. Such is Thor's hubris that he finds himself unable to lift Mjolnir. He remains steadfast, consolidating his power over Earth for many years before he remorsefully goes back in time to prevent himself from seizing power over Earth.<br><br>

As Ragnarök begins, Thor learns that the Asgardians undergo an endless cycle of death and rebirth through Ragnarök, enforced by higher beings. To break the cycle, Thor destroys the tapestry of the Three Fates, reincarnating the Asgardians as mortals. In the meantime, a clone of Thor is created by the pro-registration faction during the civil war between superheroes. While in the afterlife, Thor once again binds himself to Blake to resurrect himself, and creates a new Asgard floating over Oklahoma, gathering the Asgardians who had been reincarnated as mortals. When Loki resurrects Thor's grandfather, Bor, Bor goes into a berserker state and Thor is forced to kill him. As Bor was the rightful king of Asgard upon his resurrection, Thor is banished for regicide. While banished, Thor seeks out Sif, who was still lost from the destruction of the Asgardians. After Norman Osborn seizes power in the United States, he orders an attack on the new Asgard, and Thor returns to his home. Though Asgard is destroyed and Loki is killed after coming to Thor's aid, Thor ends the attack and his banishment is commuted. After Thor discovers that Loki has been reborn as a child with no memories, they reunite as brothers.<br><br>

In the 2011 "Fear Itself" storyline, Odin's brother Cul, who is known as The Serpent, emerges from his imprisonment by Odin, and wages war on Earth. Thor fights and defeats the Serpent, sacrificing his own life. Kid Loki seeks out Blake to resurrect Thor. A revived Thor then faces Gorr the God Butcher and teams with a younger and an older version of himself to defeat Gorr, though Gorr's condemnation of the gods shakes Thor's confidence, and he finds himself unable to lift Mjolnir. The hammer is taken by Thor's ally Jane Foster, who temporarily becomes the new Thor before inspiring his confidence and returning the role to him. When Malekith the Accursed wages the War of the Realms, Thor sacrifices his eye in exchange for the wisdom to defeat him, and Thor then reunites with his past and future selves as well as Foster's Thor to win the battle. When Galactus arrives to warn of the Black Winter, he imbues Thor with the Power Cosmic and enlists him as a herald, only for Thor to use the power to kill him.<br><br>
