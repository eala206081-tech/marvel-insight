<h3>Character Overview</h3>
<p>Quicksilver (Pietro Maximoff) is a fictional superhero appearing in Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, he first appeared in X-Men #4 (1964). He possesses superhuman speed, reflexes, and agility, making him one of the fastest characters in the Marvel Universe. Quicksilver is known for his impulsive personality and loyalty to his sister, Wanda Maximoff.</p><br>

<h3> Pietro Maximoff: The Man of Speed</h3>

<p>Pietro Maximoff is the twin brother of Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) and was raised under the early influence of Magneto. While initially aligned with his father’s villainous aims, he eventually becomes a hero, using his speed to fight alongside the Avengers and protect innocents. His character often highlights the balance between family loyalty and heroic responsibility.<p><br><br>

<h3>Origin Story</h3>

<p>Pietro and his twin sister, Wanda, were raised by Django and Marya Maximoff, a Romani couple. As adolescents, Pietro Django Maximoff and his sister Wanda discovered that they had peculiar talents. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, enraged villagers attacked the Roma camp. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The traumatic separation from their family erased almost all of Wanda and Pietro's childhood memories, with only vague recollections resurfacing in adulthood. Over the next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered Central Europe, living off the land.<br><br>

The character first appears with Wanda, now called the Scarlet Witch, as a part of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. The siblings were presented as mutants, with Pietro possessing superhuman speed and Wanda able to control probability. The pair are recruited by Magneto after he saves Wanda from a mob after she accidentally causes a house to burst into flame. Quicksilver stays with her to protect her. After several confrontations with the X-Men, they depart when Magneto and his lackey the Toad are abducted by the cosmic entity the Stranger. They then travel back to Europe. Pietro and his sister reform and are recruited by Iron Man to the superhero team the Avengers, after they discover they are advertising for new members and want to get support for themselves.<br><br>

Together with the leader Captain America and former villain Hawkeye, the four become the second generation of Avengers, and are later dubbed "Cap's Kooky Quartet". Quicksilver first thinks he should be the leader and would sometimes quarrel with the other members. The Scarlet Witch becomes close friends with Hawkeye and both become loyal members of the team until Wanda is accidentally shot on a mission against Magneto. Quicksilver then flees from the Avengers with his wounded sister. The pair accompany Magneto back to his mid-Atlantic base, where he captures the X-Men[16] and Pietro skirmishes with the X-Man Cyclops. The twins finally realize that Magneto is the true villain. Pietro and Wanda reappear in the title X-Men and are then kidnapped along with several other mutants by the robot Sentinels, and are subsequently freed by the X-Men.<br><br>

The character reappears in the title The Avengers, and advises the team that Wanda has been kidnapped and taken to another dimension by the warlord Arkon. After Wanda is rescued, Pietro and his sister rejoin the team. During one mission Quicksilver is wounded by a Sentinel and is found by Crystal, a member of the Inhumans. Crystal nurses Pietro back to health, and the pair are eventually married. Pietro and Wanda also meet Robert Frank—formerly World War II hero, the Whizzer—who was present at Mount Wundagore (the birthplace of the siblings) with his wife at the time of their birth. Frank briefly joins the Avengers, believing Pietro and Wanda to be his children. The Scarlet Witch also becomes romantically involved with her Avengers teammate, the Android Vision. Although Pietro initially disapproves, he eventually gives his blessing to their marriage.<br><br><br><br>

Quicksilver features with the Inhumans and Fantastic Four against the villain Sphinx, and the siblings' origin is explored in the title Avengers when a Romani man by the name Django Maximoff, (who is soon revealed to be their biological father), kidnaps Pietro and Wanda and returns to Mount Wundagore in the country of Transia, where they were born. After a battle with the Avengers against the Elder God Chthon, the siblings learn from Bova, one of the New Men created by the High Evolutionary, that they are the children of Maximoff, and not Robert Frank. Quicksilver then returns to Attilan (city of the Inhumans) and is revealed to have had a daughter (Luna) with Crystal.<br><br>

During the limited series Vision and the Scarlet Witch, Magneto forces Bova to reveal the truth about his missing children, who are revealed to be Pietro and Wanda. After their mother Magda dies in childbirth, the children are given by the High Evolutionary to Django Maximoff to raise as his own. Pietro and Wanda reject Magneto when told. His marriage to Crystal is also strained when she has an affair. Maximus uses technology to cause Quicksilver to become psychotic. This drove him to frame the Avengers for treason as his perceptions are twisted to perceive them as having 'betrayed' him, forcing them to escape the government-sponsored Freedom Force, and then deal with Quicksilver's new 'team' of LMD-based duplicates of the Zodiac, until the Vision convinces Pietro to stand down by showing him images of his newborn nephews.<br><br>

Quicksilver battles the West Coast Avengers and is captured by the Inhumans and cured of his condition. In an effort to repent for his actions, Pietro aids the Avengers West Coast against Magneto and the villain Immortus, who has captured Wanda. Although successful, Pietro refuses to return to Crystal and joins the U.S. government-sponsored superhero team X-Factor. The character and Crystal are reunited during the storyline "Bloodties" when the Avengers, X-Factor and X-Men team to stop a group of mutant terrorists who kidnap their daughter Luna, and are responsible for a civil war on the island nation of Genosha. After dealing with the threat, Quicksilver learns of Crystal's relationship with Avenger the Black Knight[36] and leaves, also resigning from X-Factor.<br><br>

Quicksilver confronts Onslaught along with the rest of the Avengers. They discover that the only way to defeat him is for all non-mutant heroes to merge with his body. This prevents Quicksilver from sacrificing himself alongside the rest of the team.<br><br>

Quicksilver leaves Luna with Edwin Jarvis while he deals with the fallout from the Onslaught event. He travels to the Xavier Institute to recuperate, clashing with his father Magneto (now known as Joseph) whom he blames for the apparent deaths of Crystal and Wanda. He departs with Hercules, heading to Avengers Mansion to reunite with his daughter. He soon resigns from the Avengers due to anti-mutant scapegoating by the United Nations.<br><br>

Quicksilver takes his daughter Luna and travels to Mt. Wundergore, aiding the High Evolutionary and his Knights of Wundagore against Exodus and the Man Beast. Quicksilver uses the experimental Isotope E to augment his powers, allowing him to move at greater supersonic speeds. A future version of Pietro called "Nestor" appears and reveals that his powers are not speed but rather temporal based. Quicksilver also rejoins a reformed Avengers.

With half-sister Polaris, Quicksilver spies on their father Magneto, who is now the ruler of Genosha. Quicksilver is banished when he rallies the Avengers against Magneto.<br><br>

<h3> Where He Appears </h3>
<p>Quicksilver appears in comic books, animated series, video games, and films. He has been a member of both the Avengers and the X-Men in various comic storylines. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he has been portrayed by Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015) and Evan Peters (in WandaVision, 2021), exploring his connection to Wanda and his abilities in both heroic and dramatic contexts.</p> <br><br>
