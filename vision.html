<h3>Character Overview</h3>
<p>Vision is a fictional superhero appearing in Marvel Comics. Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema, he first appeared in The Avengers #57 (1968). Vision is an android—or synthezoid—created using advanced artificial intelligence, the brain patterns of the hero Wonder Man, and vibranium technology. He possesses superhuman strength, density manipulation, energy projection, and flight. Vision is widely regarded as one of Marvel’s most philosophically complex characters, as he constantly explores the boundaries between artificial intelligence and humanity.</p><br>

<h3> Vision: The Soul Inside the Machine</h3>

<p>Although Vision is synthetic, he exhibits human-like thought, reasoning, and emotion, which sets him apart from most artificial beings. His calm demeanor, logical approach to problem-solving, and moral integrity make him a natural mediator and strategist within the Avengers. Despite being a machine, he forms deep emotional connections, most notably his romantic relationship with Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch). This relationship allows the exploration of themes rarely addressed in superhero narratives, including artificial consciousness, identity, and the nature of love. Vision’s personality embodies a delicate balance of rationality and empathy, providing a unique lens through which to examine what it means to be “alive.”<p><br><br>

<h3>Origin Story</h3>

<p>Founding member of the Avengers and scientist/adventurer Hank Pym (also known by the code names Ant-Man, Giant-Man, and Goliath) decides to experiment with creating artificial intelligence, using a combination of computer programming and recordings of human brainwave patterns. Hank's hope is to create a robot who does not just simulate emotions but can truly feel and achieve emotional growth. His work results in the creation of a robot called Ultron who immediately turns on him and escapes.<br><br>

Ultron then upgrades himself repeatedly, finally creating a formidable robotic form which can allow him to do battle. Seeing himself as superior to humanity and wishing to dominate Earth, Ultron quickly becomes a powerful archenemy of the Avengers, attacking them both on his own and through the use of agents such as the Masters of Evil team. Ultron's first ally is Eric Williams, the Grim Reaper, who blames the Avengers for the death of his brother Simon, the ionically empowered hero Wonder Man (Eric and the Avengers were unaware at the time that Wonder Man was alive and only in a coma-like state). Inspired by how strongly Eric is motivated by his connection to his brother, Ultron decides to create a companion who, like him, is capable of emotional growth.<br><br>

To create an android "son", Ultron first tracks down the body of the original android Human Torch, a Golden Age hero and android described by his creator Phineas T. Horton as a "synthetic man" replicating the physiology of an adult human male with synthetic organs, blood, tissue, muscle, and skeleton. Unknown to the living robot, the time traveling Immortus uses his powers to duplicate the original Torch moments before Ultron's arrival, creating twin copies. While Ultron takes one deactivated Human Torch back to his lab, the other deactivated Human Torch remains behind, waiting to be reactivated. Immortus did this as part of larger plans he had to manipulate the Avengers.<br><br>

In his lab, Ultron adds robotic technology of his own design to his copy of the android Torch, creating a new artificial life form with a physical appearance and abilities different from the original Torch. Primarily, this android is able to absorb and expel solar radiation and control his body's density. Ultron then copies Pym's method of replicating human brainwaves and, in recognition of his being inspired by the Grim Reaper, bases his creation's personality program on the brainwave patterns of Wonder Man. When the android is brought online, he knows Ultron to be his creator but does not know about his connection to the original Human Torch.<br><br>

Ultron sends his son (who he leaves unnamed) to Avengers Mansion. Wasp witnesses the android moving through the mansion and is startled, describing the intruder as a ghostly "vision." After battling and studying the Avengers, the android concludes they are good people whereas Ultron is corrupt. Taking the name Vision, the android aids the Avengers and turns against Ultron. The Avengers learn how Ultron created him and that he is arguably alive, his programming based on mimicking a human mind. Due to his mixture of robotics and synthetic organs, Hank Pym later remarks it would be more accurate to call Vision a "synthezoid." Seeing him as a person, and because of the team's past successes with recruiting former villains and criminals wishing to atone for past actions, the Avengers welcome the android to the team. Overwhelmed by this act of acceptance from the group, Vision immediately excuses himself and weeps.<br><br>

An alternate account of the Vision's origin includes Wasp explaining that starting a new life and finding a new identity can involve imagining "a vision" of the person you aspire to be and then trying to reach it. Affected by these words, this becomes why the android chooses his name. Yet another account suggests that the name came from a memory of Horton's prototype, a robot he created before perfecting the original Human Torch. This prototype had been nicknamed "the vision of tomorrow."<br><br>

While he is with the Avengers, Vision proves a valuable member and a loyal teammate. The villain Grim Reaper takes an interest in Vision, seeing him as his brother Simon resurrected. When the Reaper offers to transfer the Vision's mind into the comatose body of Captain America, making him truly human, Vision is uninterested but plays along to defeat him later. After multiple encounters, the Grim Reaper develops a hatred for Vision, seeing him as a mockery of his dead brother.<br><br>

Not long after joining the team, Vision is controlled by his "father" Ultron due to a control crystal the villain implanted in his son's synthetic brain (though Vision does not learn about the presence of this crystal until years later). Vision is forced to rebuild the robot villain, giving him a body of near-indestructible adamantium, and then battles the Avengers. Eventually, Vision regains control of himself and Ultron is defeated. Soon afterward, the former Avengers known as Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, and her twin brother Pietro Maximoff, Quicksilver, rejoin the team. Wanda and Vision begin forming a friendship. At times, Vision suspects he is developing feelings for Wanda but then quickly denies this, believing that even an android who has some emotional capacity is not capable of having a romantic relationship with a human. Despite this, he grows fiercely protective of his teammates and Wanda in particular.<br><br>

During the Kree–Skrull War, Vision realizes he can hide his feelings no longer and admits them to Wanda. Feeling the same for him, Wanda kisses Vision and the two become romantically involved despite the protests of Quicksilver, who believes an android cannot truly love, and Hawkeye, who has his own feelings for Wanda. Eventually, Hawkeye, as well as the other Avengers, come to agree the two make a happy couple.<br><br>

During an encounter between the Avengers and Immortus, Vision learns he was apparently constructed from the remains of the original Human Torch. This information gives him a stronger sense of identity when he realizes that he technically has a "past", even though he does not recall being the android Torch and acknowledges having a different personality. Soon afterward, Vision and Wanda are married. Soon afterward, Simon Williams is discovered to be alive due to being powered by ionic energy; his "death" having been mistaken due to his altered biology. As Wonder Man, he joins the team and learns an android had been programmed with a copy of his brainwaves. Wonder Man befriends the Vision and the two come to regard each other as twin brothers, just as Wanda and Pietro are twin siblings.<br><br>

Some time later, realizing they have never had a life together that did not involve the Avengers, Wanda and Vision take a leave of absence from the team and buy a house together in the suburbs of Leonia, New Jersey. After several months, Vision feels he and Wanda should return to active duty and the two do so. During a battle with the villain Annihilus, Vision suffers serious damage and "shuts down." Regaining consciousness weeks later, he remains paralyzed and communicates for a time through a holographic form. Connection with ISAAC, a computer system created by advanced Eternal science, helps Vision eventually repair and regain control of his body. Vision recognizes that the presence of Ultron's control crystal in his brain has inhibited the full potential of his emotional growth. With this limitation removed, Vision's mind evolves as he becomes aware of humanity's evil. Overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and disgust he has never experienced before, he becomes obsessed with world peace. To help his plan, he manipulates the Wasp into giving up her position as leader of the Avengers so he can take the position for himself. His increasingly irrational state leads to him manipulating and lying to the Avengers for months, while causing tension in his marriage.<br><br>

As Vision ponders whether or not his plan will actually help, he and Wanda learn their home in Leonia has been burnt down by bigots who objected to the presence of a mutant (Wanda was mistakenly believed to be a mutant at the time) and her android husband. Taking the arson as a sign, Vision acts on his plan and temporarily takes control of various computer systems, weapons systems, and government databases across Earth. Doing so causes Vision great mental strain; he quickly realizes that what he has done his wrong and that the crystal is negatively influencing his emotional judgment. After the Avengers help disrupt his control over Earth's computers, Vision reaches into his own body and takes out the control crystal. Able to think clearly again, he apologizes for his actions and resigns from the Avengers, along with Wanda. To spare the Avengers military retaliation, Vision reveals only part of the truth to the US government, saying the loss of control they experienced was a malfunction he alone caused and that the Avengers were equally victimized by his actions, adding that he is prepared to accept the consequences. This convinces the international community that Vision and the Avengers are not an active threat, but several government operatives from different countries do not trust the situation and decide to collectively monitor the android.<br><br><br><br>

After buying a new house in Leonia, Vision expresses his hope that one day he and Wanda can have a family. Later on, Wanda is brought to New Salem, a community of sorcerers. The villainous magic-users in charge perform a ceremony they hope will vastly increase their powers. Wanda taps into the immense mystical power herself and is about to release it harmlessly, when she hears the voice of her deceased teacher, the sorceress Agatha Harkness, telling her to use the power before she gives it up. Wanda thinks of her desire for children with Vision, then releases the excess magical energy. Soon afterward, she discovers she is pregnant. Months later, Wanda goes into labor and the sorcerer Dr. Strange delivers her twin children Thomas and William ("Billy"), named after Phineas T. Horton and Simon Williams.<br><br>
