<h3>Character Overview</h3>
<p>Falcon (Sam Wilson) is a fictional superhero appearing in Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Gene Colan, he first appeared in Captain America #117 in 1969. Known for his aerial combat skills, advanced winged flight suit, and partnership with Captain America, Falcon is one of Marvel’s most prominent Black superheroes. Sam Wilson is celebrated for his leadership, compassion, and dedication to justice, eventually taking up the mantle of Captain America himself.</p>

<h3>Sam Wilson: The Man with Wings</h3>
<p>Sam Wilson grew up in Harlem and dedicated his life to helping others, first as a social worker and later as a hero. After bonding with his falcon Redwing and gaining advanced training, he becomes the Falcon, patrolling the skies with enhanced mobility and tactical skill. Sam’s connection with Steve Rogers forms the emotional backbone of many Marvel stories, showcasing a partnership built on trust, equality, and shared ideals. Over time, Sam’s courage, integrity, and unwavering commitment to doing what’s right lead him to assume the role of Captain America, continuing Steve’s legacy while redefining it with his own voice and values.</p>

<h3>Origin Story</h3>
<p>Samuel Thomas Wilson was born in Harlem, New York City, to Paul Wilson, a prominent minister, and Darlene Wilson. Wilson had a happy childhood and finds he has a natural affinity for birds. He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem. In his teens, however, encounters with racism leave him jaded. When he is 16, Wilson refuses to join the church, believing his deeply religious parents to be ignorant for their faith. To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight (originally Paul was said to have been killed when Sam was 9 years old). Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment. The tragic death of his parents does not stop Sam from being a respected community volunteer.<br><br>

As a grown adult, Sam continued doing social work and meets Captain America on Exile Island (years later, he would say "I actually loved this place quite a bit. It's where I met my two best friends," referring to Captain America and Redwing). The once-peaceful island had been taken over by the Exiles, a group of would-be world conquerors who had collaborated with the Nazi supervillain the Red Skull during World War II. They had been betrayed by the Red Skull and were forced to remain in hiding on the island, enslaving the natives. Wilson finds and befriends Redwing, a falcon with which he feels a remarkably strong bond.<br><br><br><br>

Wilson is an upright and cheerful social worker who is eventually lured to the Exiles' island and organizes the natives to fight for their freedom. Steve Rogers (Captain America) befriends him there and convinces Wilson to adopt a persona to inspire the natives in their rebellion. The two create the costumed persona the Falcon and train together extensively before attacking and defeating the Exiles and the Red Skull. The Falcon becomes Captain America's regular partner in crime-fighting, and briefly even takes on the Captain America costume and identity when Rogers is believed to have been killed.<br><br><br><br>

Later, again as the Falcon, Wilson receives help from Black Panther, who creates a harness for him, allowing him to fly. When Rogers briefly abandons his Captain America identity, others attempt to take up the mantle, including a young man named Roscoe whom the Falcon mentors. When the Red Skull eventually kills Roscoe, Rogers again becomes Captain America.<br><br>

Soon afterwards, the Red Skull tricks Sam into believing that he had a secret past as Snap Wilson, a professional Los Angeles criminal and gang member persona created out of grief and "angry at the world" following the death of Sam's parents. Red Skull makes the untruthful claim that the Cosmic Cube was used to erase the memories of this Snap Wilson past so that Sam could be used as a mole for Red Skull. Red Skull then unsuccessfully attempts to use the Cosmic Cube to make the Falcon kill Captain America. Believing in the existence of this fake criminal past but deciding to continue as a hero, the Falcon is eventually named head of the Super Agents at the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D.<br><br><br><br>

US government superhero liaison Henry Peter Gyrich then recruits Wilson, one of the few active black superheroes, to fill a mandated racial quota for the venerable team the Avengers. Resentful of being a "token", the Falcon quits at the first opportunity. He debuts a new costume when he fights the supervillain Taskmaster.<br><br>


<h3> Where He Appears </h3>
<p>Falcon appears in comic books, animated series, video games, and films. In the comics, he plays major roles in Captain America, The Avengers, and his own solo series, including storylines exploring his leadership and responsibilities as the new Captain America. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he is portrayed by Anthony Mackie, appearing in films such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Endgame, and the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which chronicles his journey toward becoming Captain America.</p> <br><br>
